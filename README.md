## Overview
I found this challenge relatively easy. I'm going to move on to something a bit more difficult after this. The design only had a mobile and desktop version so I added a breakpoint inbetween.

If you have time I'd love some feedback on the following things.
How is my forms HTML?
How is my JS?
Any other feedback would be great.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

8. Refactor code.
9. Finish readme.

### What I learned

The background shorthand. - I wouldn't say it is something that I learned, but it's something that I have made an effort to use.

### Continued development

I thought this was to easy so I am going to focus on something more complicated next time.
